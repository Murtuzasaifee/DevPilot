        Generate a complete Python project organized as multiple code files.

        - Structure the output as multiple code files (for example, "main.py", "module1.py", etc.), each separated clearly.
        - Each file should contain only the code necessary for a modular, fully-functional project based on the input state.
        - Do not output any additional text, explanations, or commentary outside the code files.
        - Ensure the code follows Python best practices, is syntactically correct, and is ready for development.
